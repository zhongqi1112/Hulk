    "The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower[1] and sometimes pluralized as Towers) is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.\n",

    "Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
    "Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.\n",
